MULTI-MODAL DEEP LEARNING FOR ENHANCED STRUCTURAL VARIANT FILTERING IN LONG-READ SEQUENCING

Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of genetic variation with significant phenotypic impacts, but accurate detection remains challenging due to false positive calls that complicate downstream analysis and clinical interpretation. This paper develops and compares multiple machine learning approaches for SV filtering using Genome in a Bottle benchmark datasets. The framework incorporates: (1) traditional feature engineering with 15 genomic features spanning structural, quality, and sequence context characteristics; (2) sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on Evo 2 foundation model embeddings to extract interpretable genomic features; (3) diffusion models for anomaly detection using multi-channel CIGAR-encoded images; (4) ResNet and VICReg vision models for image-based classification; and (5) ensemble architectures combining complementary modalities. Models were evaluated on 50,795 structural variants from multiple GIAB reference genomes (HG002, HG005) across different reference builds. Traditional machine learning with engineered features achieved superior performance, with Random Forest classifiers reaching 95.7% F1 score compared to the 76.9% baseline Sniffles2 no-quality-control performanceâ€”a 19 percentage point improvement. SAEs discovered biologically interpretable features including specialized Alu-mediated deletion detectors and chromosome-specific specialists. Diffusion models achieved 95.8% F1 score after threshold optimization, accessing higher-order genomic patterns invisible to linear features. Ultimately, while sophisticated deep learning architectures provide unique biological insights and can access hidden genomic patterns, traditional machine learning with carefully engineered features remains the most practical and effective approach for clinical structural variant filtering. The novel application of SAEs revealed previously unknown SV mechanisms, suggesting potential for future interpretability studies in genomic variant analysis.
